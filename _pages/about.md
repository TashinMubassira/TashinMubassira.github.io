My primary research interests lie at the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)**, **Security and User Privacy**. I am also enthusiastic about **Ubiquitous Technologies** and systems with a particular focus on **Distributed Systems** and **Database Design**. Through my work experience, I have developed a keen interest in accessible learning and collaborative technologies for individuals with physical and intellectual disabilities.
