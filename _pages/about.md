My primary research interests lie at the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)**, **Security and User Privacy**. I am also enthusiastic about **Ubiquitous Technologies** and systems with a particular focus on **Distributed Systems** and **Database Design**. Through my work experience, I have developed a keen interest in accessible learning and collaborative technologies for individuals with physical and intellectual disabilities.

Recent Research Areas:
- Human-centered computing, Design and evaluation methods, Usability testing: [\[NSysS 2024\]](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/nsyss2024/)
- Interaction Techniques, Gestural Inputs, Mental Health: [\[EAI Mobiquitous 2023\]](https://mobiquitous.eai-conferences.org/2023/)

Besides these,
- I am an active member of [Bangladeshi Women in Computer Science and Engineering (BWCSE)](https://bwcse.wordpress.com/)
- I have participated in Bangladesh Math Olympiad (BDMO) several times throughout my high school years and am enthusiastic about maths

My teaching experience includes,
- Mentoring two undergraduate students in research projects
- Tutoring 9th to 12th grades students for six years
